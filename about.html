      <h2>About the Author</h2>
      
      <div class="about-otter-oaks">
        <p>Otter Oaks came from the mind of a mid-twenties corporate worker.</p>
        <p>All inspired by day to day life and experiences that mirror many, I want to illustrate the lives of those I know and love.</p>
        <p>Everyday our stories are being written, so to see something relatable from time to time in the form of cute little animals might make it a bit easier to process.</p>
        <p>I've always found that reading the comics with the more poorly drawn characters and wonderully written story are the ones worth reading. As someone whos seen a thing or two I guess this is my way of putting my two cents into the world. I hope my stories and experiences can help people get through their days, process their feelings, and learn from my mistakes. My hope is that people see this and relate to it and feel a contection not only myself, but to the community that could form in sharing our live with each other.</p>
